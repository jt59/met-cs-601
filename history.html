            <header><h2>Geography</h2></header>
            <p>Belize is located west of Guatamela, and borders both Guatemala and Mexico. An interesting fact
                that I learned on my trip is that, due to convoluted political technicalities, Guatemala recognizes the southern
                half of Belize as Guatemalan territory. Allegedly, children in Guatemalan schools are taught that the border
                of Guatemala extends all the way to the Caribbean, as shown in the table. To read more, check out this

                <p>
                    The Maya lived in what is current day Belize for centuries before the arrival of Europeans. They left behind 
                    numerous major ruin sites including La Milpa, Xunantunich, Altun Ha, and Caracol. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Spanish invaded
                    and claimed the territory as their own. While Carter and I were staying in San Pedro, we took a boat back to the mainland to visit a 
                    Mayan ruin site called Lamamai, which translates to "submerged crocodile". Read more about Lamanai here:

                </p>
                <p>
                    Archeologists have divided the evolution of Maya culture into 9 distinct periods, shown below. Lamanai was at its height during the Early and Late Classic Maya period.

            <p>
                British buccaneers and loggers began settling in Belize in the mid-17th century. Spain retained sovereginty for a few decades,
                although a growing British population led to increased political tensions between the European powers. The British overcame
                the Spanish in 1798, and Belize became a "settlement" of Britain, which was politically distinct from a colony. Belize became the official British colony 
                of British Honduras in 1862; however, Guatemala challenged British occupation on the grounds that it had inherited Spanish intersts in the area.

            <p>
                Belize appealed its case for self-determination to the United Nations in the 1970s. Although the border dispute with Guatemala remained 
                unresolved, Belize gained indpendence on Septembet 21st, 1981. The British military retained a presence in Belize in order to 
                reinforce the established border between Guatemala and Belize until 1994, when the Belize Defense Force gained full responsibility 
                of border security. Read more about Belizean independence here:
