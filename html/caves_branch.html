                <p>For the last few days of our trip, we flew back to the mainland to stay at a jungle lodge along the Caves Branch River. Carter and I 
                    had many amazing adventures here, including cave tubing, repelling into the Black Hole, and jumping down cave waterfalls.</p>

                <p>My favorite adventure in Caves Branch was repelling into the Black Hole, a giant sink hole which formed in the limestone. We hiked 
                    through the jungle for about 45 minutes before reaching the edge of the 280-ft sink hole. Our guides attached us to cables, and we 
                    repelled down the cliff wall into Black Hole.</p>

                <header><h2>Waterfall Hike</h2></header>
                <p>On our last full day in Belize, Carter and I hiked through a cave, climbing up and jumping down 5 different waterfalls. This was the 
                    scariest part of the trip for me-- hiking through the narrow, rocky cave was challenging, and then when it came time to jump off the falls,
                    we had to jump in the exact right spot so we didn't hit our heads on the cave ceiling, or land on top of rocks at the bottom. Despite the 
                    challenge, this waterfall hike was absolutely incredible!</p>
