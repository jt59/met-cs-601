Project Title: Jillian's Trip to Belize

Decription:
This website informs users of my recent to trip to Belize, Central America. It consists of 5 pages:
1) Welcome
    -Introduces the user to the background of my trip.
2) Belize background and history
    - Prior to traveling to Belize, I didn't know much at all about its history. This page is not specific to my trip, but rather it informs users of the country's general history.
3) Ramon's Village in San Pedro
    - This page informs users of my time in San Pedro, Belize.
4) Caves Branch Lodge in Belmopan
    -This page informs users of my time in the jungle region of Belize.
5) Photo Gallery
    -A place to view all photos and videos

CSS Styling:

Navigation bar:
-The navigation bar is consistent across all pages of the website
-Created using Flexbox
-When the user hovers over a link in the nav bar, it changes color to indicate clickability

Media queries:
-largest screen is 1200px+
    -At this point, the web design starts using flexbox to organize content
    -The pictures and videos move onto the right side of the screen, while the text content remains on the left
    -Paragraph text and headers are largest
- medium screen size is 730px to 1200px
    -Flexbox no longer applies, and the text begins to wrap around the images and videos
    -Paragraph and header font sizes become smaller
-smallest screen size is 730px or less
    -font size decreases once more
    -font size in the nav bar decreases to fit on a single line of the screen

Images and Videos:
-I added a border to the pictures and videos to make them look like polaroid photos with captions

Font:
-I imported a google font to give the site more of a fun and carefree aesthetic
